<h1>Confetti</h1>

<p>Confetti is a tiny tool for managing different versions of a particular
configuration file, and quickly swapping them.<br /></p>

<p>```
$ ls ~/.aws</p>

<p>credentials (the credential file we're using at any given time)
work.credentials (credential file for work)
my.credentials (credentials for my personal aws account)
```</p>

<p>With a small amount of yaml based configuration, we could swap out credentials like so:</p>

<p><code>$ confetti aws work</code></p>

<p>And credentials would be a symlink to work.credentials.</p>

<p>You can also link multiple different config targets together to have groups of config files that can all be swapped with a single command. </p>

<p>Confetti will read it's configuration from <code>~/.confetti.yml</code>. You can even manage your <code>.confetti.yml</code> files using <code>confetti</code>!</p>
